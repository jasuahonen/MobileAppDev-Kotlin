Created by Jasu Ahonen for TAMK/Mobile App Development on 05/2024.


This repo hosts a WeatherApp built using Android Studio &amp; Kotlin Language

The main screen features current weather, min&max for the day, sunrise, sunset, wind speed, pressure, humidity and info on the author

We have a button that opens up a 2nd screen that displays the 5-day temperature with 3-hour intervals. 2nd screen also hosts a button that redirects back to the main screen with current weather.
